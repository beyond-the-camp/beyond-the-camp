On request, movies in various languages can be screened, and listened to using bluetooth headsets. The visitors can also enjoy themselves by playing a game of FIFA. â€¨The room is separated from the rest by a thick red curtain. Visitors sit between self-made pillows on wooden stairs, and can enjoy the movie in a calm, pleasant atmosphere.
