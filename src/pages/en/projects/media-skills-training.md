Come and learn photography, video production, sound recording and graphic design, working with a team of professional and dedicated teachers. 

Together here we have created short films, documentaries, photography exhibitions, recorded live music at One Happy Family and produced a magazine which was written, researched and designed by refugees living in Lesvos.
