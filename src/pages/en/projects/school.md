Children learn major subjects including English, maths, reading and writing skills in their own language. 

Teachers from the refugee community who can teach in Arabic or Persian conduct the classes.

Throughout the week, the children enjoy enrichment activities such as hikes, artistic activities, music, and creative games. 

Older children from the refugee camp are trained to become guides and counsellors for the younger students and help in leading the entire school framework. 

Every month a special communal event is conducted in which all parents participate.
