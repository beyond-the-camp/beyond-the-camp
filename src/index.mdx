# Getting started

These docs lets you explore the UI components used in the project in isolation.

Choose components from the menu to see a preview of what they look like and the 
corresponding source code.

Note that some global styles aren't applied in these previews, but it should still 
be enough to give you an idea of how the components can be used.
